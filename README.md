A lot of messy code :S

wdg.rb
====
Just a snippet of code which should receive a binary file using TCP sockets, execute some gdb commands over it and return results to the client.

Run the server, and "cat /bin/ls |ncat localhost 2000".

ipcowcat.go
====
The supersimple http service running on ip.cow.cat.
